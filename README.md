# Credit-Card-Report
Here are four files which I attached. There are two csv files customer and credit card which contain data in their respective columns. A PDF file which is a simple presentation of the overview of the insights gather from the Dashboard of Credit Card Transaction Report and Credit Card Customer Report and a screencort of both of the dashboard and for getting more knowledge about insights lets have a look into Credit_Card_report.pbix file. For creating this dashboard we write DAX query also for getting more insights from them such as query in revenue,full_gender_name,age_group and customer_income_type(low,medium,high).
